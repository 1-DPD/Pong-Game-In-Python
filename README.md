# Pong-Game-In-Python
I recreated Pong in Python. In this game, Two players use paddles to hit a ball back and forth, trying to prevent it from hitting their back wall. If the ball hits a player's back wall, the other player scores a point. The game ends when a player scores a certain number of points.
